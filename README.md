# TIC-TAC-TOE

> Implement a Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby

This project is about creating a Tic Tac Toe game to be played from the command line.

## Built With

- Ruby

### Prerequisites
- Ruby installed.
- Clone this repository on your local environment:
  - From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository. 
  - Clone using the following command, for HTTPS: ```git clone https://github.com/alvaropazz/tic-tac-toe.git``` for SSH ```git clone git@github.com:alvaropazz/tic-tac-toe.git```.

### Setup
Either use the following [link](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) to make the file executable and type ```$ main``` on the command line, or run the command ```$ ruby bin/main.rb``` on the directory where the repo is stored to execute the program.

## Instructions

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. The first player is 'X' and the second player is 'O'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
