To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
Ruby installed.

### Setup
Either use the following [link](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) to make the file executable or run the command $ ruby main to execute the program.

### Usage
After making the main file executable, run the file on the command line to start a new game.

## Instructions

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. The first player is 'X' and the second player is 'O'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
